> Since your average joe (me) doesn't know how to navigate through lebanon with all the different routes of every van and service drivers expected payments. Wen Wasel is an app that solves all the above by guiding the user to live van stops and previous service rides.
> 
> The app allows van drivers to input their routes with their arrival time and shares their live location with the users. Ensuring more passengers on their respective routes.
>
> The app allows passengers to book seats at vans and browse through different possible routes to their destination as well as providing them with live guidance to their destination.

### User Stories
- As a van driver, I want to add routes, so that I can find more passengers.
- As a passenger, I want to find a route, so that I can reach my destination.
- As a passenger, I want to book van seats, so that I can ensure it's availibility.

> This design was planned before on paper, then moved to Figma app for the fine details.
Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
